I am originally from Afghanistan and came to Australia six years ago.
The main language spoken in Afghanistan is Dari and Pashto, both of which I can speak. I can also speak Hindi, which is the main language spoken in India, and Urdu, which is Pakistanâ€™s main language, and of course English. 
I have been married for four years and have a beautiful two-year-old daughter. 
In my personal time, I love spending time with my family especially with my daughter, and exercising. 
I have previously completed courses in the Dental and Health Science fields; qualifications from which I gained employment at a dental clinic where I currently work as a dental nurse.
